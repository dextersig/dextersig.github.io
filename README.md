# dextersig.ca - Personal Website

## About

This is the source code for my personal website. 

## Features

* **Custom CSS theme** -  Something important to me was special theming that feels simultaniously professional and fun. One long term goal is to host a broad variety of content: From a portfolio to small games, proper colours and aesthetics are vital in making that wide variety of content feel natural.
* **Unofficial CSSA Webring** - A webring featuring fellow students from the Computer Science Student Department at the University of Manitoba.
* **Death, Tax, and Off-By-One Errors** - My personal blog about ethics and Computer Science. Includes an RSS feed and automatic sorting by published date.
