Hello, My name is Dex! I'm a student working towards a Computer Science degree at the University of Manitoba.

This website is built with the Eleventy SSG with a custom CSS theme, and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/dextersig/dextersig.github.io). There's some minimal javascript enabled for the webring links, but all of the content on the site is accessible even with scripts disabled.

I have the most fun programming when I get to work on things with unique requirements, restrictions, or goals. Having to take things into consideration that aren't usually an issue on modern systems is an engaging thought experiment. In the future, I'd love to demake a modern game for a retro video game console.

Here's a list of some of my favourite things:
* **Music Album:** Spiritual Machines - Our Lady Peace (2000)
* **Movie:** Hackers (1995)
* **Video Game:** Metal Hellsinger (2022)
* **Book Series:** The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - Doug Adams
