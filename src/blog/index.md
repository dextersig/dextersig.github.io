title: Death, Taxes, & Off-By-One Errors
---
**Welcome to the home of Death Taxes & Off-By-One Errors!**

Death, Taxes, & Off-By-One errors is my creative outlet to write about life and the computer science industry, and the way they intersect. Some of the topics covered include Privacy and Security, Right to Repair, and more. 

Originally, this project was born out of a passion for the topics being covered in my introductory ethics in Computer Science course. Since then, this blog has moved from [Bear](https://bearblog.dev/) to hosting the blog on my own website.
