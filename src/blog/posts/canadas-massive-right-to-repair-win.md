Recently, Canadians and Right to Repair activists scored a win! [Bill C-244](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-244?view=progress) and [Bill C-294](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-294?view=details) are the first federal bills in support of the Right to Repair movement to be passed, *in any country*. Despite one inescapable problem with the bill, I still consider it an overall win for repair groups across the world.

Let's start by recapping the story so far. Simply put, the Right to Repair movement aims to give individuals the ability to modify and repair their technology products as they please. A common misunderstanding is that Right to Repair would *force* people to repair their own technology, which isn't the case. We just want the ability to repair technology without any involvement from the manufacturer; it's totally okay if Apple, John Deere, or any company *also* offers repair services for their own hardware. 

Yes, I used the word "we" when talking about this movement. Full disclosure inbound; I am a **strong** proponent of Right to Repair, and I also happens to live in Canada! Putting my personal interest in modifying and repairing technology aside, the ability to work on hardware without permission of the manufacturer creates less environmental waste, the individual components are cheaper than buying an entire replacement device, and expanding the repair industry creates jobs to serve people who don't know how to repair their own technology. 

[Cory Doctorow covers these aspects of repair in much more depth](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/15/radical-extremists/) during his own post about the new Canadian bills. I highly recommend reading the post for yourself, to grasp a more in-depth understanding of the benefits seen in Right to Repair.

One of the largest challenges around Right to Repair is heavy-handed usage of Technological Protection Measures, referred to as TPMs for short. Ever wonder where the joke about [McDonald's ice cream machines always being broken](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279371/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machines-right-to-repair-copyright) came from? It's because (up until now!), the manufacturer of these machines, Taylor, added TPMs that prevented third-party repair, so that their repair technicians were the only ones who could fix the machines.

Breaking past a TPM also ~~qualifies~~ qualified as a Copyright violation. Originally, TPMs were developed as an anti-piracy measure. However, awhile after copyright law was updated to outright ban the breaking of TPMs, companies started using the technology to restrict access to repairing devices.

Canada's new legislation is pretty straightforward: [Bill C-244](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-244?view=progress) is an exception to the Copyright Act that allows for repairing devices. If that weren't enough, [Bill C-294](https://www.parl.ca/legisinfo/en/bill/44-1/c-294?view=details) specifically amends the Copyright Act to allow for interoperability. This would bypass the frequent anti-repair practice of [parts pairing](https://www.ifixit.com/News/69320/how-parts-pairing-kills-independent-repair), where companies tie the model number of two components to each other, in order to prevent third-party replacements from being installed.

While it's great to see these bills passed, there's a large problem; while technicians might have permission to bypass a TPM...

**[*getting access* to the tools required is still illegal](https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/12/canada_right_to_repair/).**

It's a massive asterisk on the bill that really dampens the entire win. After all, if I want to repair something with a complicated TPM, it becomes impractical to spend a **lot** of time developing the skills and knowledge to reverse-engineer and implement the crack myself, without discussing with anyone else in any form. The laws go from a massive win for Right to Repair, to a avenue for politicians to virtue signal about Right to Repair. This hurdle being kept in place after new legislation is *almost* enough to not celebrate over it.

*Almost*. I like to take a more "Glass Half-Full" approach to technology discussions where I can, and there's still a lot to be excited about regarding the new bills. 

For starters, this isn't the first bill to be passed with similar amendments to equivalents of our countries' Copyright Act, but it is the first to be passed *on a federal level*. That sets a precedent for other countries to do the same. It would be great to see this kind of amendment to Copyright law become a standard across developed countries.

That universality would be great because there *are* some simple TPMs that are possible to bypass individually. Primarily, this would effect simple password locks, especially on slightly older devices where passwords might be small enough that modern technology can crack a password relatively quickly and simply.

I hope the new bills are a first domino, tipped over and leading to stronger repair legislation. There are lots of ways to go about it. Further amendments to the Copyright Act that allow for the distribution of repair tools, or a bill that prevents companies from implementing TPMs that restrict hardware repair would be perfect. It would be even more exciting to see my home country at the forefront of that groundbreaking legislation. If you feel the same, please consider supporting [CanRepair](https://www.canrepair.ca/), the amazing Right to Repair group that got the new bills passed in the first place.
