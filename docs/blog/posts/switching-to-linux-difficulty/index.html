      <h2 class="post-title">Switching to Linux: Is It Difficult?</h2>

      <p><i>Jul 12, 2024</i></p>

      <p>Short answer: Yes. But also, no? It's complicated.</p>
<p>Jumping into Linux with no research, no understanding, and no backup plan if it doesn't work out can be... frustrating. There are horror stories online about folks who dive head-first into Linux because they're tired of Microsoft's shenanigans. Then, they get overwhelmed with how different it can be from Windows. Then, they move off Linux because of the problems they face. Truthfully, I also felt upset with Linux when I first started using it.</p>
<p>So, what do you do if you're interested in getting away from Microsoft's privacy disaster? The most important thing to do when learning the Linux ecosystem is to <em>move slow</em>.</p>
<p>I started out by installing Linux Mint alongside my copy of Windows 10 on my SSD, commonly referred to as dual booting. I only used it sometimes, or until I ran into a problem that I wouldn't be able to fix with my (extremely limited) knowledge. It worked okay most of the time, but there were a few small annoyances that I didn't understand how to fix, so I spent most of my time on Windows.</p>
<p>One morning, Windows randomly deleted my wifi drivers that I needed to register for university courses. Thankfully, my installation of Linux Mint connected to the internet completely fine. I was totally okay to register for courses because I had Linux installed.</p>
<p>After that, I started using Mint more and more often. I eventually learned how to eliminate or reduce those annoyances from earlier. About a year and a half after installing Linux for the first time, I don't even have Windows installed on any of my systems. I'm currently using <a href="tab:https://www.debian.org/">Debian 12</a> full time, and I rarely run into issues.</p>
<p>First thing you should do; <em>backups, backups, backups</em>! Make sure <strong>any</strong> valuable data is backed up somewhere that won't be affected by installing a new operating system. Linux won't delete your Windows installation if you don't select that (more on this later), but there's always the possibility of an accidental mistake. The goal is to be able to wipe the computer completely and start with a fresh installation of Windows without permanently losing any important photos, videos, or other data.</p>
<p>Picking a &quot;distribution&quot; of Linux is probably the most difficult and intimidating part of the process. There are hundreds of different variants out there, and it's not immediately clear what the differences are. A good choice for a first time user should be recognized by the wider Linux community as an option that's friendly for beginners. For the love of everything computing, do <strong>not</strong> start with <a href="tab:https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>. It should have a large community of users behind it, so that troubleshooting steps are easy to find. Many people's first recommendation is <a href="tab:https://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>, which was also my first distro. <a href="tab:https://zorin.com/os/">ZorinOS</a> is also a great option, and might feel more familiar for people switching from an Apple device.</p>
<p>When you've chosen a distro, install it <em>alongside</em> your other operating system. Dual boot on the same SSD as your gaming rig, overwrite that ten year old laptop gathering dust in your closet, or even try things out in a virtual machine first. <strong>Please don't purge Windows from your life right at the start!</strong> Even if you only use Linux once a month, it still gets you a little bit more comfortable each time. There are a lot of Windows programs that are difficult or even impossible to get working, so you need to make sure that you have everything you need on Linux before a complete switch.</p>
<p>Transitioning to Linux can be difficult without tempered expectations. I wouldn't call it more difficult to use than Windows, but it can definitely feel that way because it's different. Make sure to backup any important data to another device, pick a good beginner distro, and please don't fully erase Windows right at the start. Missing any of these steps can lead to massive frustrations. Following the steps makes the process of getting away from Windows or Apple not just less stressful, but even enjoyable.</p>
