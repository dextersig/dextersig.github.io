      <h2 class="post-title">Does Canada&#39;s Tech Industry Have a Future?</h2>

      <p><i>2025-05-25</i></p>

      <p>Recently, there's been a large movement amongst Canadians to stop buying American products, and replace those products with Canadian-made alternatives. Discussing why that shift is happening is outside of the scope of this post, but watching this happen as a Canadian planning to enter the Computer Science industry is incredibly interesting.</p>
<p>Computer software and hardware is one of the industries that Canada (and the rest of the world) relies on the United States for. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, and all of the largest tech companies in the world are based in the United States. There are Canadian technology companies, but we mostly rely on the United States for our digital infrastructure.</p>
<p>I've been researching differnet Canadian tech products lately, and I've found some unique ideas that I'd like to share! This is by <em>no</em> means a comprehensive list of Canadian tech though, just a few of the items that I've personally tried and had a positive experience with.</p>
<h3><a href="https://ploopy.co">Ploopy</a></h3>
<p>Ploopy is a Canadian hardware manufacturer! Those are few and far between nowadays, so I wanted to highlight one of my personal favourites. Founded in 2019, their primary claim-to-fame is their trackball mice, but they also make a couple other items like regular mice, trackpads, and headphones.</p>
<p>One other shtick they have is open sourcing all of their work; documentation, build instructions, QMK/VIA firmware, even design files! They offer DIY kits for assembling the parts yourself, but it would be totally possible to create one completely from scratch.</p>
<p>They obviously also offer fully assembled products on their website alongside the DIY kits. This is how I ordered my <a href="https://ploopy.co/product-category/trackball/adept/">Ploopy Adept</a> trackball, and daily usage has been a great experience so far! I've been playing Ghostrunner 2, and it actually feels more responsive than my previous midrange Logitech mouse, which was a welcome surprise. The buttons are responsive and clicky, and an extra bonus is being able to fiddle with the ball during loading screens.</p>
<p>The one small piece of criticism I have so far is that the type of sensors used to track the ball make a good amount of noise. This isn't a big deal for me, I actually like the noise, but it might put off others. I can't advocate for their quality, but there are unofficial mods to reduce the noise made by the sensors. That's the nature of open source projects: With the right skills anyone can modify things to fit their own needs. It's awesome to see a Canadian group following the same ideology that propelled companies like Framework to success, but with their own unique lineup of products.</p>
<h3><a href="https://gem.cbc.ca/">CBC Gem</a></h3>
<p>The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is a Crown Corporation that serves as Canada's public broadcaster. They're oldest continually existing broadcasting network in Canada, which means they have a large catalouge of Canadian-made content under their belt. They utilize this advantage to create some products that work as alternatives to American tech companies.</p>
<p>Gem is the CBC's video streaming service. They carry a lot of Canadian made content, both new and old. It's a great experience to be able to comb through the catalouge of Canadian made content, the offerings they have feel much more meaningful than the tsunami of content on streaming services like Netflix or Hulu. I've been working through a few different shows on there: Blackberry, Murdoch Mysteries, and Shitt's Creek are a few examples. I've never had any issues with the streaming quality or bugs.</p>
<p>Best of all is that there's a free ad-supported tier, and the premium tier is very affordable at $5.99 per month. For comparison sake, Netflix charges the same amount... to add an extra user to your account... <strong>with ads.</strong> Netflix's ad-supported tier is $7.99 month, and the closest equivalent tier to CBC's premium tier is more than three times as expensive at $18.99 per month. Disney+, Amazon Prime, and other streaming services are even more expensive.</p>
<p>While not a complete replacement for traditional streaming services (<a href="https://www.crave.ca/en">Crave</a> is probably your best bet), CBC Gem is a quality, afforable, Canadian-oriented option. Even if you're not sure this is the right option for you, I highly reccomend at least trying out the ad-supported tier and seeing if it's worth upgrading to the premium tier.</p>
<h3><a href="(https://mauril.ca/en/)">CBC Mauril</a></h3>
<p>A less appreciated CBC app is their language app, Mauril! It uses the CBC's vast catalouge of shows and movies to teach French and English, the two official languages of Canada. It's a great alternative to apps like Duolingo, which have had lots of criticism levied at them for context-free teaching, a gamified system, and forcefully pushing AI onto their users.</p>
<p>While I haven't used it for very long, through a few days of usage I was able to recall a few words and phrases that I originally learned in my elementary school French classes. Your milage may very, especially for advanced users, but as a completely free service for Canadians there's nothing to complain about here.</p>
<h3><a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a></h3>
<p>I'm willing to bet that this will be the most surprising item on this list. This is a privacy-oriented mobile operating system that actually has their non-profit foundation <a href="https://www.canadacompanyregistry.com/companies/grapheneos-foundation/">incorporated in Canada</a>!</p>
<p>Anyone who's been following my blog probably has seen this name before, as I <a href="https://www.dextersig.ca/blog/posts/android-without-google-3-days/">previously wrote in-depth about using it in a different blog post</a>. Ironically, even I didn't know about their Canadian origins at the time! It simply stood out as the best option out of any of the aftermarket Android versions.</p>
<p>There is one catch in the context of this post, though: GrapheneOS only works on Google Pixel phones, an American company. If you already have a Pixel phone, I can 100% recommend it, the Sandboxed Google Play feature means you can ditch a vast majority of the spying that Google does without any loss in functionality. You can also look at buying a Pixel on the second-hand market to install GrapheneOS.</p>
<h3>So, does Canada's Tech Industry Have a Future?</h3>
<p>The short answer is: I like to think so.</p>
<p>On one hand, Canadian tech is currently facing a gargantuan &quot;brain drain&quot; problem. We live directly on top of the largest tech industry in the world, bar none. Canadian computer scientists looking to enter the industry can easily get a TN visa to work in the United States and recieve a comically better wage than working for a Canadian tech company.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Canada has a very rich history of innovation in the technology space. ATI, now owned by AMD, used to be based out of Markham, Ontario. They've been the primary competitor to Nvidia's monopoly on the GPU space since the bankruptcy of 3dfx in 2000. Blackberry pioneered the idea of mobile devices, and practically invented the modern smartphone. Even in recent times, we've had success stories like Shopify, one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the world.</p>
<p>There's a strong hunger for Canadian-based tech alternatives right now. It feels like every time I open the fridge, there's some forum post somewhere about how BlackBerry should get back into the consumer smartphone space, or how Canadian Tire has the infrastructure to rival Amazon. I'll be watching closely to see if any of these ideas come to fruition, and would happily make a follow-up article in a few years when these ideas had a chance to come to fruition.</p>
