      <p>Welcome to the new home of Death Taxes &amp; Off-By-One Errors!</p>
<p>One of my first classes at the post-secondary level was an introductory ethics class in the computer science department. I was already interested in much of the course content, but the course sparked an active interest in keeping up with what's going on in the computer science industry. This blog is both a passion project, as well as a creative outlet for me to write creatively about topics in computer science like Privacy and Security, Right to Repair, and more.</p>
<p>This blog originally was hosted on <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">Bear</a>, which is still an excellent service that I would reccomend to those wanting to start their own blog without the hassle of creating the entire website from scratch. In 2025, I merged it with my personal website so that you, the reader, can get all of me that you want in one place (well, except my Mastodon account).</p>
